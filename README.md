# Library Inventory Management System

This project is a Python-based Library Inventory Management System that allows users to manage a collection of books. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), arrays (lists), and lambda functions, while providing a simple, functional solution for managing book inventories.

## Features
- Add, remove, and update books in the inventory.
- Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- Sort books by various attributes such as title, author, or publication year using lambda functions.
- Track the availability of books (borrowed or in stock).
- Display the entire book collection with relevant details.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Core language used for development.
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): Used to model books, inventory, and borrowing system.
- Arrays (Lists): Data structure used for storing the collection of books.
- Lambda Functions: Utilized for sorting and filtering operations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saxonjude/library-inventory-system.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd library-inventory-system

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python library_inventory.py

## Usage
- Use the system to add new books to the inventory.
- Search for existing books by title, author, or availability.
- Sort and filter books to find what you're looking for quickly.
- Update the status of books when borrowed or returned.

## Best Practices
- This project follows Python's best practices to ensure clean, readable, and maintainable code:
- Object-Oriented Design: The system models real-world objects like books and the inventory, encapsulating related properties and methods. This modular approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- Descriptive Naming: Variables, methods, and classes are named with clarity and intent, making the code easier to understand and extend.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Common operations are abstracted into reusable functions to minimize code duplication.
- Efficient Data Handling: Arrays (lists) are used to store and manage collections of books, and lambda functions are applied for efficient sorting and filtering operations.
- Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs and ensure the program runs smoothly.
